# Interactive Bézier Rope

## Files
- `interactive-bezier-rope.html`

## Quick Start
1. Save `interactive-bezier-rope.html` to disk.
2. Open it with any modern browser.
3. Move your mouse around or drag the control points to interact.

## Essentials
- Implements a **cubic Bézier curve** and its **derivative** manually.
- Two inner control points (**P₁**, **P₂**) are dynamic with **spring-damper physics**.
- Endpoints (**P₀**, **P₃**) remain fixed.
- Tangents are visualized by computing the derivative B′(t).
