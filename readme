# Interactive Bézier Rope

## Files
- `interactive-bezier-rope.html`

## Quick Start
1. Save `interactive-bezier-rope.html` to disk.
2. Open it with any modern browser.
3. Move your mouse around or drag the control points to interact.

## Essentials
- Implements a **cubic Bézier curve** and its **derivative** manually.
- Two inner control points (**P₁**, **P₂**) are dynamic with **spring-damper physics**.
- Endpoints (**P₀**, **P₃**) remain fixed.
- Tangents are visualized by computing the derivative B′(t).

## Physics
acceleration = -k * (position - target) - damping * velocity

Integrated using **semi-implicit Euler** for stability.

## Controls
- Adjust stiffness (`k`), damping, tangent length, and sample count using the right-side UI panel.

## iOS Adaptation
To adapt for iOS:
- Replace mouse input with **CoreMotion** gyroscope values.
- Use `CADisplayLink` to call the same update loop at 60 FPS.

## Recording
Use your OS screen recorder:
- macOS: `Shift + Cmd + 5`
- Windows: `Win + G`
- Linux: `OBS` or `simplescreenrecorder`
